This folder contains all the SSM Automation documents developed and published as global documents.
Any SSM document shall be named as per the following guidelines:
- The start of the document shall indicate the publisher acronym. All AWS published documents that will be developed here will begin with 'testaws-' *(as a document with aws- cannot be created outside of the team)*

- All of the documents will follow the following folder structure:
    * **ProjectName** - root for every document project
